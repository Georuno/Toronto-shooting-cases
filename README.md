## Overview of Paper

This repository explores (1) The communities most affected by shootings and (2) Changes and factors in the number of shootings each year. While there was an overall increase in shootings from 2014 to 2019, some divisions in the Greater Toronto area had relatively higher crime rates. Further exploration of these divisions revealed high-density, multicultural and low-income neighborhoods with serious gang problems. If we further analyze the relationship between different community backgrounds and shootings, we will also find that the gun ban policy may ignore the key points."
